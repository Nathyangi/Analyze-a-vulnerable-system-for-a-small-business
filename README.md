# üõ°Ô∏è E-Commerce Vulnerability Assessment

This portfolio project simulates a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment of a remote database server for an e-commerce company. It demonstrates my skills in identifying critical security issues and proposing effective mitigation strategies.

## üîç Project Overview
- **Scenario:** The company stores sensitive data on a public-facing remote database used by remote employees worldwide.
- **Problem:** The database has been open to the public since launch, leading to major security risks.
- **Goal:** Identify vulnerabilities, assess risk, and provide secure configuration solutions.

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system.
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose
The database server is a centralized computer system that stores and manages large amounts
of data. The server is used to store customer, campaign, and analytic data that can later be
analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing eforts. It is critical to secure the
system because of its regular use for marketing operations.

## Approach
Risks that were measured considered the data storage and management procedures of the
business. Potential threat sources and events were determined using the likelihood of a
security incident given the open access permissions of the information system. The severity of
potential incidents were weighed against the impact on day-to-day operational needs.

## Remediation Strategy
Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only
authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based
access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in
motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users
from the internet from connecting to the database.

## üõ† Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Nmap (port scanning)
- Shodan (public exposure check)
- Threat Modeling
- Report Writing
- OWASP Top 10

## üß† What I Learned
- How misconfigurations expose systems to unauthorized access.
- Importance of authentication, encryption, and access controls.
- Clear communication of cybersecurity risks to decision-makers.
