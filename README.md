# 🛡️ E-Commerce Vulnerability Assessment

This portfolio project simulates a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment of a remote database server for an e-commerce company. It demonstrates my skills in identifying critical security issues and proposing effective mitigation strategies.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Scenario:** The company stores sensitive data on a public-facing remote database used by remote employees worldwide.
- **Problem:** The database has been open to the public since launch, leading to major security risks.
- **Goal:** Identify vulnerabilities, assess risk, and provide secure configuration solutions.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Identify real-world vulnerabilities in exposed cloud systems.
- Perform risk assessment aligned with OWASP/NIST standards.
- Simulate threat modeling using basic tools and visuals.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Nmap (port scanning)
- Shodan (public exposure check)
- Threat Modeling
- Report Writing
- OWASP Top 10

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How misconfigurations expose systems to unauthorized access.
- Importance of authentication, encryption, and access controls.
- Clear communication of cybersecurity risks to decision-makers.

## 📁 Files Included
- `vulnerability_report.md` – Full written assessment
- `threat_model.png` – Visual model of risks
- `tools_used.md` – Explanation of tools like Nmap and Shodan

## 🔐 Disclaimer
This project is a simulation for educational purposes only. No real-world systems were scanned or compromised.
